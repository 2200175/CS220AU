# How can the existential risk of a Nuclear holocaust be reduced by our digital identity?

## The first step towards decreasing the existential risk is awareness
Our digital identities can be used to inform the public of these risks and raise awareness of important topics that can lead in extreme cases to human extinction. 
In this case, I have chosen a Nuclear holocaust as an important existential risk. In these articles I intend to explore more deeply the risk of a nuclear attack, and how some governments, through alerts on our mobile phones, may be collecting data about us, all those traces we leave on the networks, which are becoming more and more numerous, and therefore invading our privacy. It is here that different ethical questions were raised that I will try to address in these articles. 

## Nuclear risk is real 
Due to the war between Russia and Ukraine Europe and the rest of the world have seen how easy is for a country to threaten with a nuclear attack. 
The continued offensives by both sides have put the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants at risk. Shelling of Ukrainian energy infrastructure continues as Russian forces in the Donbas threaten to carry out an "all-out attack" on Ukraine.

In fact Russia has in the last few weeks conducted a nuclear test attack, which Russian President Vladimir Putin himself says the potential for conflict around the world remains very high. 
Seeing how easy it would be for a country to launch a massive nuclear attack, how can we use our digital identities to try to reduce this existential risk? 

## Digital identities used to protect citizens 
Actually, citizens have already started to use their digital identities to increase their security in case of nuclear attack. 
This is the case of the citizens in a region of Spain, called Tarragona, where thermal and nuclear power plants are located, have used their digital identities to alert the population in case of a gas leak or fire. 
It all started when there was a major fire at one of the plants a few months ago, and the public was not alerted until 5 hours later. During this time, citizens experienced moments of tension and uncertainty, as the smell of gas was present throughout the city and the flames could be seen for miles around. People began to share pictures on tweets or WhatsApp and fake news was quick to appear. 
It was after this episode that it became clear that there was a need to create a kind of immediate official governmental warning that could alert the public via personal phone of such incidents.

our digital identities may not be able to stop a catastrophe, but they can help protect the maximum number of people from it by creating a way to alert the population.

## The real case of mobile alerts in Spain  
Spain has already started testing the new disaster alert a few days ago. 
The Directorate General of Civil Protection oversees launching this new system of alerts to the population called ES-Alert, which will send warnings directly to the mobile phones of citizens affected by a possible emergency or catastrophe. This system has been tested in all communities. Many phones will receive a text alert accompanied by a beep warning of an impending emergency.

## SWOT Analysis
In order to analyze the weaknesses, strengths, threats and opportunities of the government's warnings via the population's mobile phones, I have carried out a SWOT analysis. 

 Weaknesses: with this system, the government leaves out people who do not have mobile phones, such as the elderly. By not having a mobile phone, these people would be at risk, because if they do not have someone with a mobile phone at their side who can receive the alert, they would be much more likely to flee the disaster site, and would therefore be subject to a much higher level of radiation. 

 This weakness could be turned into an opportunity if the government were to give free of charge to those who do not have a mobile phone an adapted telephone. They could also give classes to the elderly on how to use the phones, thus including those people who have been excluded due to the rapid spread of technology. 

 Strengths: lives would be saved, as thanks to the alert, the population could flee and protect themselves from radiation. At a time when every minute counts, receiving this alert would save time. 

 Threats: in the future, this text message warning could be converted into an application where the current status of the nuclear power plant, radiation levels and subsequent warnings from the government, recommendations and bans could be seen. In this way, the government, through the app, would be able to collect much more of our private data. 
Another threat is that the government may not be an expert in nuclear attacks and therefore the population is only focusing on the information provided by one actor. 

Therefore, the question arises here: wouldn't it be better to decentralise this government app and turn it into apps created by private companies, which would therefore encourage competition, making each app better and better. 
 
On the one hand, we should analyse the benefits of the app being centralised, because if the government controls it, citizens theoretically have no doubts about the information they are receiving, i.e. they trust that the information is verified and official as it comes from a government body. Moreover, if the information is centralised, it does not give rise to fake news, as no one doubts the legitimacy of the information transmitted by a country's government. 

On the other hand, the harms of a government-controlled app would also have to be analysed. It could be that the best experts in nuclear energy do not work together with the government, and therefore the information communicated through the app is not 100% accurate. 
By centralising the app, it could lead to certain citizens criticising the app, proposing improvements and certain governments, such as that of China, for example, where there is neither full democracy nor full freedom of expression, applying sanctions, such as imprisonment, to those citizens who question the app. 

Benefits of decentralizing the application would basically be that it would encourage competition and therefore innovation and development. It would therefore allow different companies to create an application where they could receive all the necessary information in the event of a nuclear attack. In this way, citizens would have not just one application, but four, for example. The fact of having several of them allows people to obtain information from different media and contrast what they are receiving in a free way and at the same time ensure that the information comes from experts, as they can see who exactly is transmitting the information to them. 

In opposition, decentralizing implementation would also have its drawbacks. People could be victims of fake news, receiving alerts that might not be true. For example, a video of a nuclear attack from years ago could be disseminated pretending that it is current, and these applications could give the warning without having been properly contrasted. Another drawback could be the uncertainty that it could cause people about whether a warning is true or not, as there are so many applications. Perhaps one disproves it and the other affirms it, and this would therefore lead to confusion and uncertainty for the population.


## Moral questions to take into account  
Somehow therefore, mobile phones will be tracked and disrupted by this signal, and although most of the population believes it is a good way to be alerted, to what extent would the government be invading our privacy, and collecting data on our digital identities? So, who is going to handle this data and for what purpose?

## Have we given consent? 
Mobile privacy is the order of the day. More and more users are concerned about preventing their personal data from being exposed during their daily interaction with different mobile resources: mobile applications, the use of apps with geolocation, mobile websites, etc. Therefore, when creating an app, security should be paramount.

Nowadays, more and more people surf the web in the resident mode, introduced by Marc Prensky, which is based on the fact that users surf the web leaving a social trace that remains there after they go offline.
In this mode, people think the web as a series of spaces or places, for being present with other people online. 

To what extent can governments access our mobile phone to send a warning signal, for example a nuclear alert, even if the user has not given prior consent? 
It is conceivable that governments or companies could use this invasion of privacy as an excuse to extract these traces of our digital identity and use them for commercial purposes, for example. 
Thus, without the user's express consent, users' privacy would be violated.

## Current ethical practices and data protection
The report "Data, Privacy & The Individual. Getting Privacy Right in the Digital Era", published today by IE University's Center for the Governance of Change (CGC), in collaboration with Telefónica Digital Policy Lab, explores some of the key ethical issues related to privacy raised by emerging technologies. It also looks at new technical methods that governments and companies can use to harness information while respecting existing regulation and maintaining the trust of both their customers and citizens.
Data is the main fuel of our digital economy. Our financial transactions, movements, communications, relationships and interactions with governments and businesses generate data that is collected, bought and sold.

Establishing ethical data practices and developing technical means to protect sensitive data are two key pillars to keep citizens safe and overcome the privacy challenges we face in the digital age.

Citizens have begun to understand the real cost of using digital technologies and our society is having to relearn the value of privacy through the negative consequences of privacy breaches. In fact, according to a survey of more than 1,000 citizens included in this report, negative experiences related to online privacy are extremely common: 92% of citizens have had at least one privacy breach in their lives and this number will continue to grow in the coming years. 
The report also reveals that 97% of citizens believe that privacy is a right, and 82% of respondents consider privacy to be extremely or very important. Similarly, 88% of respondents consider violations of the right to privacy to be one of the most important dangers facing citizens in the digital age.
This research also confirms that many of the ethical challenges we face today are related to power asymmetries: when it comes to data, individuals are systematically at a disadvantage vis-à-vis companies and governments. In this context, the report urges companies to do what they can to empower users and increase their autonomy.
In addition, it says we should invest more in developing better privacy tools and better digital ethics. "If we invested a fraction of what we are investing in the development of Artificial Intelligence in privacy and ethics, we would have much more reason to be optimistic about the future of the digital age," say the researchers.
